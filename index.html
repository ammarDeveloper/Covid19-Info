            <div class="faqs">
                <p class="para"><strong>Q:</strong>Are there any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine?</p>
                <p class="para"><strong>A:</strong>
                    Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short term side effects, such as a low-grade
                    fever or pain or redness at the injection site. Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away
                    within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible
                    but extremely rare.</p>

            <div class="faqs">
                <p class="para"><strong>Q:</strong>Can I get COVID-19 while swimming?</p>
                <p class="para"><strong>A:</strong>The COVID-19 virus does not transmit through water while swimming. However, the virus spreads between people when someone has close contact with an infected person.</p>
